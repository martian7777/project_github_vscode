# RepoDeck Wiki

Welcome to the **RepoDeck** wiki! RepoDeck is a lightweight, high-performance GitHub client built directly into VS Code and designed to support alternative editor forks (such as Google Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, etc.) by bridging the gaps in standard GitHub integration.

RepoDeck provides:
- **Interactive Project Boards (v2)**: Support for Kanban (Board), spreadsheet (Table), and Gantt-style (Roadmap) views.
- **Robust Authentication**: Session integration or Personal Access Tokens (PAT) stored securely in `SecretStorage`.
- **Developer Workflows**: One-click repository initializer and automated issue-to-branch setup ("Start Working on Issue").
- **Performant Detail Panels**: Fast loading via local caching and rich markdown rendering for issue/PR descriptions, comments, and events.
- **GitHub Actions**: Browse workflow runs, jobs, and steps; re-run or cancel runs; and manage Actions secrets, variables, and environments (with client-side secret encryption) — all from the sidebar.
